# Complex Equation Generator
This was a silly little concept I haven't seen made pubicly. The code has a bunch of premade vectors with equations, Theres 4 main types of equations generated:
```
Random Zero - Generate an equation that equals 0
Random One - Generates an equation that equals 1
Random Redundant - Generates an equation that will always equal the input
Random Equation - Generates a completely random equation with a predetermined outcome
```
The program picks these functions at random to add to the equation, predicts the equations outcome, then either adds or subtracts the equations output to match the original input.
This was a quick side project, made for fun. Reminder: **This is not accurate, the equation outcome will be extremely close to the input but not 100% accurate**
